  	<div id="about_me">
  		I am a new B.ASc undergraduate pursuing Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I believe I am a capable and responsible student with appropriate, adaptable and affirmative skills. I love to program and spend most of my free time self learning and creating projects. In fact, I created this website in order to better understand web development and specifically front-end languages. My hobbies include listening to music, working out and watching movies. I love meeting and working with new people, so feel free to send me a message!
