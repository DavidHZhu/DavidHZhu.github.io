  		<h2 style="text-align:justify; font-size:45px;">About Me:</h2>
  		<p>I am a new B.ASc undergraduate pursuing Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I believe I am a capable and responsible student with appropriate, adaptable and affirmative skills. I love to program and spend most of my free time self learning and creating projects. In fact, I created this website in order to better understand web development and specifically front-end languages. My hobbies include listening to music, working out and watching movies. I love meeting and working with new people, so feel free to send me a message! </p>

  				<p>One of my most recent and most different projects was this Arduino electric keyboard. It features 8 "notes" and an LCD screen. It was able to record and playback a few seconds of what the user had inputed as well as had a pre-set library of songs that I transposed. The goal for this project was to explore the hardware aspect of technolgy and how it implements the software that I had been learning up to that point. It really helped me develop organizational,documentational and debugging skills as the added dimension of hardware added hundreds of possible reasons as for why the project wouldn't work.</p>

  				<img class="InvaderPic hvr-grow" src="images/invader.jpg">
  				<p>This project was a parody of the classic arcade game "Space Invader" in C using a graphical library known as Allegro 4. It was a mainly to practice what I had learned in class. From this project, I was able to apply my knowledge of functions, reading and writing to files, collision, projectiles, - the list goes on. Other features included random enemy spam positions, highscores, and power-ups. One of my main inspirations for learning software was video games and video game design. With this, I was able to temporarily call myself a game developper. ;P</p>

  				<p>I created this Reverse-Polish-Notation calculator in C++ for my Grade 12 computer science course. The idea was to use all of our software development principles in order to properly create a project. This project was created using stacks as the primary tool. Graphics were created initally using ASCII art but then I upgraded to an Allegro 5 GUI. I believe this project helped me understand classes, header files and their implementation in the grand scheme of things. Never knew programming a calculator could be so rewarding. </p>
